## Introduction
  - The purpose of this project was to allow students to sharpen their CSS and HTML skills learned in the past couple weeks of class. There are other extensions that test different skills that we can build on. The project allowed us to personalize/entertain different ideas with HTML/CSS as well as the functionality(JavaScript) behind the web page created.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Features
- Pick a "mantra" or "affirmation" and receive a kind message to improve your day.
- The Choose Your Own Adventure I chose was to handle error messages (if a choice is not selected but a message is requested), timeout and reset your form after selection.

## Deployed Page

## Possible Future Extensions
  - Create your own mantras to add and come back to and enjoy at a later date.  Adding local storage to save the aforementioned mantras would be cool too!
